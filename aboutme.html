    <p> Hello, Anvitha!!! :)</p>
    <p style="color:aliceblue">Hello! I am Anvitha Kachinthaya, a junior at Dublin High School. I absolutely love to travel, wherever it may be to, and I have an obsession with reading and writing. I will read books in almost any genre. My other hobbies include singing, dancing, baking, playing tennis, learning and volunteering. Service is my passion, and I volunteer with Kids Against Hunger and at the Dublin Library. Being able to make a difference in someone's life, no matter how small, is extremely rewarding.</p>
